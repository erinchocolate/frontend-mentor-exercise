## My process

### Built with

- Sass
- BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

How to use BEM naming convention:

BEM stands for Blocks, Elements and Modifiers.

```html
<div class="card">
    <div class="card__img">
```

I use Sass to write css for the first time:

- I set up Live Sass Complier extension on VS code
- I use nesting and variable in my Sass file

```scss
$dark-cyan:hsl(185, 75%, 39%);
$dark-desaturated-blue:hsl(229, 23%, 23%);
.card__stats {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 2fr 2fr 1fr;

  &__box {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
  }
}
```
